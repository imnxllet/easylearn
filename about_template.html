						<h2>What We Do</h2>
						<!--
						<p>Our mission is to provide the best experience for students who wish to explore different parts of the world through study tour. Students will not only learn the difference in culture and lifestyle, they can also get an impression of the industry at which they are interested outside of their country. We hope to lead students into discovering their true interests with intact course content while providing them the opportunity to develop valuable relationships aboard.
						</p>-->
						<p>
							We provide summer camp for students that wish to explore other option other their country. The goal is to allow students to gain industry insights that fit their interests as well as understanding the value of Canada. We do so by allowing these students to meet professionals in the industry, explore company building and create workshop that benefit their personal growth. By the end of the camp, students should have great knowledge towards the subject taught in the camp (depends on the type of camp the students choose).
